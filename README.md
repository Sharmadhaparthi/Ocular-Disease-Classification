# Ocular Disease Classification

The project was completed in September 2021

•	The aim of the notebook is to claasify the annotations labeled by trained human readers with quality control management into two labels including normal and cataract.
•	Performed exploratory data analysis, augmentation of images, one-hot encoding and image generator techniques to enhance results. 
•	Various visualization techniques such as correlation matrix, pairplot (bar plot) are implemented in the study of data distribution.
•	Deep learning model is implemented using Keras and Tenson Flow.
•	Implemeted VGG-16 and VGG -19 models
•	 Rectified linear unit (ReLU) is used as the activation function and Binary cross entropy is used as cost function. 
•	ADAMN is implemented for gradient descent.
•	Executed hyperparameter tuning for the models and obtained classification accuracy of 89%
